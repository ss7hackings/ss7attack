SS7 hacks are mobile cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in the SS7 protocol to compromise and intercept voice and SMS communications on a cellular network.

Similar to a Man In the Middle attack, SS7 attacks target mobile phone communications rather than wifi transmissions.

SS7 Attacks
With access to SS7 and a victim’s phone number, an attacker can listen to a conversation, pinpoint a person’s location, intercept messages to gain access to mobile banking services, send a USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) command to a billable number, and conduct other attacks.
